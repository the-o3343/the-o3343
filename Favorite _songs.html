    Verse 1

    Hey there Delilah, what's it like in New York City?
    I'm a thousand miles away, but girl, tonight you look so pretty
    Yes you do 
    Times Square can't shine as bright as you, I swear it's true

    Verse 2 
    Hey there Delilah, don't you worry about the distance
    I'm right there if you get lonely give this song another listen
    Close your eyes
    Listen to my voice, it's my disguise, I'm by your side

    Chorus
    Oh, it's what you do to me
    Oh, it's what you do to me
    Oh, it's what you do to me
    Oh, it's what you do to me, what you do to me

    Verse 3
    Hey there Delilah, I know times are getting hard
    But just believe me, girl, someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar
    We'll have it good
    We'll have the life we knew we would, my word is good

    Verse 4
    Hey there Delilah, I've got so much left to say
    If every simple song I wrote to you would take your breath away
    I'd write it all
    Even more in love with me you'd fall, we'd have it all

    Chorus
    Oh, it's what you do to me
    Oh, it's what you do to me
    Oh, it's what you do to me
    Oh, it's what you do to me

    Bridge
    A thousand miles seems pretty far
    But they've got planes and trains and cars
    I'd walk to you if I had no other way
    Our friends would all make fun of us
    And we'll just laugh along because
    We know that none of them have felt this way
    Delilah, I can promise you that by the time we get through
    The world will never ever be the same, and you're to blame
    Hey there Delilah, you be good and don't you miss me
    Two more years and you'll be done with school
    And I'll be making history
    Like I do
    You'll know it's all because of you
    We can do whatever we want to
    Hey there Delilah, here's to you
    This one's for you

    Final Chorus
    Oh, it's what you do to me
    Oh, it's what you do to me
    Oh, it's what you do to me
    Oh, it's what you do to me
    What you do to me
    Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
    Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
